Solar panels cost roughly $10 per square foot.
A satellite is roughly 500 square feet.
This means that the solar panel alone would cost around $5000.
However, this is just the panel, and it requires protection from space, as well as a laser to fire back energy.

Some estimate that each satellite costs about $1 million to produce, making the $5000 spent on solar panels alone seem irrelevant.
To fuel a satellite, it is expected for each satellite to carry roughly 3 tons of fuel.
Rocket fuel weighs in at about 770 gallons per ton, and cost roughly $1.65 per gallon as of 2015.
This means that fuel costs about $3811.5

The launch cost for each satellite is roughly $20 million.

Repair information is hard to find, so that is something I need to continue to research.

Satellites last for about 10 years, meaning that each panel in the array must be replaced that ofren.

To calculate our data, a few things must be kept in mind: cost of the full satellite, cost to launch, cost to repair, fuel cost, and satellite lifetime.
With these values, any information we want to display can be calculated.

ie:
Total cost of satellite: sat cost + launch cost + fuel cost + (repair cost * lifetime)
