# Dyson Swarm Simulation
Software Engineering Project

## Introduction

This simulation is meant to roughly mimick the form that a Dyson Swarm surrounding the sun would take.


## Functions

1. Display the simulation
  * Display the graphics of the required objects (sun, mercury, space)
  * Show any satellites add to the simulation
  * Display the buttons meant to alter the simulation's state

2. Manage user inputs
  * Alter the simulation's speed when the appropriate speed button is clicked
  * Add a satellite to the simulation when the satellite button is clicked
  * Reset the simulation when the reset simulation button is clicked
  * Change the satellite variables when text box value is changed
