Devin's Work on base estimates:
Solar panels cost roughly $10 per square foot.
A satellite is roughly 500 square feet.
This means that the solar panel alone would cost around $5000.
However, this is just the panel, and it requires protection from space, as well as a laser to fire back energy.

Some estimate that each satellite costs about $1 million to produce, making the $5000 spent on solar panels alone seem irrelevant.
To fuel a satellite, it is expected for each satellite to carry roughly 3 tons of fuel.
Rocket fuel weighs in at about 770 gallons per ton, and cost roughly $1.65 per gallon as of 2015.
This means that fuel costs about $3811.5

The launch cost for each satellite is roughly $20 million.

Repair information is hard to find, so that is something I need to continue to research.

Satellites last for about 10 years, meaning that each panel in the array must be replaced that ofren.

To calculate our data, a few things must be kept in mind: cost of the full satellite, cost to launch, cost to repair, fuel cost, and satellite lifetime.
With these values, any information we want to display can be calculated.

ie:
Total cost of satellite: sat cost + launch cost + fuel cost + (repair cost * lifetime)

Seamus N's work on energy:
Energy the sun emits 3.86*10^26watts of energy every second so that equates to 3.33504e+31watts every day.

A solar panel get get about 400watts absorbed in a 24 hour period.

Energy from the sun takes 8 minutes20 seconds to get here

One billionth of the suns energy actually gets to earth, if the panels absorb more of that then they can hopefully be more efficient in the transfer.
